# /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults written by Joachim Falk. This file is
# in the Public Domain.
#
# This is a configuration file for the tigervnc-standalone-server and the
# tigervnc-scraping-server packages.
#
# After this file, $ENV{HOME}/.vnc/tigervnc.conf will be sourced, so values can
# be overwritten on a per-user basis.
#
# Next, command-line options overwrite the settings in both this file as well as
# the user's tigervnc.conf config file.
#
# Finally, /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory is parsed. If this file
# exists and defines options to be passed to Xtigervnc, they will override any
# of the same options defined in a user's tigervnc.conf file as well as options
# given via the command line. The vncserver-config-mandatory file offers a
# mechanism to establish some basic form of system-wide policy.

# This file has Perl syntax and is source from the tigervncserver script. Every
# value has suitable defaults, so you probably don't need any modifications.
# If you want to reactivate default values, you have to specify an undef value.
# For example, $fontPath will set to the default value after
#
# $fontPath = "/foo";
# $fontPath = undef;
#
# If you are missing something, please let me know.

# System configuration
# --------------------
#
# This section contains entries that should be true for all users.

# $fontPath should be a comma-separated list of fonts to be added to the font
#           path. If not specified, the default will apply.
# Example:
#       $fontPath = "tcp/localhost:7100"; # would force Xtigervnc to use xfs.
# Example:
#       $fontPath = "";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic,";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/:unscaled,";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/:unscaled,";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1,";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi,";
#       $fontPath .= "/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi,";
#
# Default: $fontPath = undef; # Use Xtigervnc built-in default font path.

# $PAMService specifies the PAM service utilized for Unix username and password
#             authentication. This service is used for the *Plain security types
#             (i.e., Plain, TLSPlain, and X509Plain) or when $RequireUsername is
#             "yes" and any of the RSA-AES security types (i.e., RA2, RA2ne,
#             RA2_256, and RA2ne_256) is used to establish the connection to the
#             VNC server.
#
# Default: $PAMService = "tigervnc"; # if /etc/pam.d/vnc is absent.
# Default: $PAMService = "vnc";      # if /etc/pam.d/vnc is present.

# $sslAutoGenCertCommand is used to auto-generate the certificate
# for the X509Cert and X509Key options. The configuration for
# openssl is taken from /etc/tigervnc/openssl.cnf where we substitute
# @HostName@ by the fully qualified domain name of the host.
#
# Example: $sslAutoGenCertCommand =
#  "openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -days 365 -nodes";
#
# Default: $sslAutoGenCertCommand =
#  "openssl req -newkey ec:/etc/tigervnc/openssl-ecparams.pem -x509 -days 2190 -nodes";

# $sslAutoGenRSAKeyCommand is used to auto-generate an RSA key for the RSA-AES
# security types.
#
# Example: $sslAutoGenRSAKeyCommand =
#  "openssl genrsa -out RSAKeyFile 2048";
#
# Default: $sslAutoGenRSAKeyCommand =
#  "openssl genrsa -out RSAKeyFile 4096";

# User configuration
# ------------------
#
# This section contains entries that may change from user to user.
# You can overwrite these settings by providing a ~/.vnc/tigervnc.conf
# configuration file.

# $vncUserDir contains the filename for the log files directory of Xtigervnc
#             (the server) and the viewers that are connected to it.
#
# Default: $vncUserDir = "$ENV{HOME}/.vnc";

# $vncPasswdFile contains the filename of the password file for Xtigervnc.
#                This file is only used for the security types VncAuth,
#                TLSVnc, and X509Vnc.
#
# Default: $vncPasswdFile = "$vncUserDir/passwd";

# $vncStartup points to a script that will be started at the very beginning
# when neither $vncUserDir/Xtigervnc-session nor $vncUserDir/xstartup is present.
# If $vncUserDir/Xtigervnc-session is present, it will be used. Otherwise, we try
# $vncUserDir/xstartup. If this is also absent, then we use the script given by
# $vncStartup. If $vncStartup is specified in $vncUserDir/tigervnc.conf, then this
# script is used unconditionally. That is without checking for the presence of
# $vncUserDir/Xtigervnc-session or $vncUserDir/xstartup.
#
# Default: $vncStartup = "/etc/X11/Xtigervnc-session";

# The $session option controls which X session type will be started. This
# should match one of the files in /usr/share/xsessions. For example, if there
# is a file called gnome.desktop, then $session = "gnome" would start this X
# session. The command to start the session is passed to the $vncStartup
# script. If this is not specified, then /etc/X11/Xtigervnc-session will start
# the session specified by /usr/bin/x-session-manager.
#
# Default: $session = undef;

# $xauthorityFile should be the path to the authority file that should be used
#                 by the Xtigervnc server.
#
# Default: $xauthorityFile = "$ENV{XAUTHORITY}"        # if the env var is defined.
# Default: $xauthorityFile = "$ENV{HOME}/.Xauthority"; # otherwise

# $desktopName should be set to the default name of the desktop.
#              This can be changed at the command line with -name.
#
# Default: $desktopName = "${HOSTFQDN}:nn ($USER)" # Where nn is the display number.

# $geometry is is only used by the standalone TigerVNC server. It sets the
#           framebuffer width & height. A default can be derived if the
#           tigervncserver is run in a X session -- either $ENV{DISPLAY} or the
#           session given by $getDefaultFrom -- with the -xdisplaydefaults
#           option. The geometry can also be changed at the command line with
#           the -geometry option. Otherwise, the fixed default provided below
#           will be used.
#
# Default: $geometry = "1920x1200";

# $depth       sets the framebuffer color depth. Must be one of 16, 24, or 32.
# $pixelformat sets the default pixelformat.
#              A default can be derived if the tigervncserver is run in a
#              X session -- either $ENV{DISPLAY} or the session given by
#              $getDefaultFrom -- with the -xdisplaydefaults option. The depth
#              and pixelformat can also be changed at the command line with
#              the -depth and -pixelformat options. Otherwise, the fixed
#              defaults provided below for the two settings will be used.
#
# Example: $depth = "16";
#          $pixelformat = "rgb565";
#
# Default: $depth = "24";
# Default: $pixelformat = undef;

# $wmDecoration sets the adjustment of $geometry to accommodate the window decoration
#               used by the X11 window manager. This is used to fully display
#               the VNC desktop even if the VNC viewer is not in full screen mode.
#
# Default: $wmDecoration = "8x64";

# $getDefaultFrom sets the display for the -xdisplaydefaults option if
#                 tigervncserver is not called in an X session, i.e.,
#                 the $ENV{DISPLAY} variable is not set. The -xdisplaydefaults
#                 option can be used to derive values for the above three
#                 options, i.e., $geometry to $pixelformat. The $getDefaultFrom
#                 value will be added to the call of xdpyinfo.
#
# Example: $getDefaultFrom = "-display localhost:0";
#
# Default: $getDefaultFrom = undef;

# $scrapingGeometry is only used by the scraping TigerVNC server. It specifies
#                   the screen area that will be shown to VNC clients, e.g.,
#                   640x480+320+240. The format is <w>x<h>+<xoff>+<yoff>, where
#                   `+' signs can be replaced with `-' signs to specify offsets
#                   from the right and/or from the bottom of the screen.
#                   Offsets are optional, +0+0 is assumed by default (top left
#                   corner). If the argument is empty, full screen is shown to
#                   VNC clients (this is the default).
#
# Example: $scrapingGeometry = "640x480+320+240";
#
# Default: $scrapingGeometry = undef;

# $localhost should the TigerVNC server only listen on localhost for
#            incoming VNC connections.
#
# Example: $localhost = "yes";
# Example: $localhost = "no";
#
# Default: $localhost = "yes"; # if $SecurityTypes does not contain any TLS*
#                              #    or X509* security types or the $SecurityTypes
#                              #    does contain at least on *None security type.
# Default: $localhost = "no";  # Otherwise

# $SecurityTypes is a comma-separated list of security types the TigerVNC server
#                will offer. Available are None, VncAuth, Plain, TLSNone, TLSVnc,
#                TLSPlain, X509None, X509Vnc, X509Plain, RA2, RA2ne, RA2_256, and
#                RA2ne_256.
#
# Example: $SecurityTypes = "X509Vnc,X509Plain,TLSVnc,TLSPlain,VncAuth";
#
# Default: $SecurityTypes = "VncAuth"        # if localhost is enabled (the default)
# Default: $SecurityTypes = "VncAuth,TLSVnc" # otherwise

# $RequireUsername specifies if authentication should be performed via Unix
#                  username and password (yes) or the VNC password file (no)
#                  when utilizing one of the RSA-AES security types (i.e., RA2,
#                  RA2ne, RA2_256, or RA2ne_256).
#
# Example: $RequireUsername = "yes";
# Default: $RequireUsername = "no";

# $PlainUsers specifies a comma-separated list of user names that are allowed to
#             authenticate via any of the *Plain security types (i.e., Plain,
#             TLSPlain, etc.) or the RSA-AES security types in the case that
#             $RequireUsername is "yes". Specify "*" to allow any user to
#             authenticate using these security types. The default only allows
#             the user who has started the VNC server. The VNC server checks the
#             password for a user via the PAM service given by the $PAMService
#             option.
#
# Example: $PlainUsers = "user1,user2";
# Example: $PlainUsers = "*";
#
# Default: $PlainUsers only contains the user starting the VNC server.

# $X509Cert and $X509Key contain the filenames for a certificate and key used
#           by the security types X509None, X509Vnc, and X509Plain.
#
# Default: $X509Cert is auto-generated if absent and stored in
#                    ~/.vnc/${HOSTFQDN}-SrvCert.pem
# Default: $X509Key  is auto-generated if absent and stored in
#                    ~/.vnc/${HOSTFQDN}-SrvKey.pem
#
# If filenames are given for $X509Cert and $X509Key either here or on the
# command line via -X509Cert and -X509Key options, then the auto-generation is
# disabled, and the user has to take care that a usable certificate is present.

# $RSAKey contains the filenames for an RSA key in PEM format used by the
#         RSA-AES security types.
#
# Default: $RSAKey   is auto-generated if absent and stored in
#                    ~/.vnc/${HOSTFQDN}-SrvRsaKey.pem
#
# If a filename is given for $RSAKey either here or on the command line via the
# -RSAKey option, then the auto-generation is disabled, and the user has to take
# care that a usable RSA key is present.
